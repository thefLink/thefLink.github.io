# Polymorphic shellcode

For this assignment three polymorphic versions of existing shellcodes had to be created. 
The polymorphic versions must not be larger then 150% of its original version.

I wrote polymorphic versions for:
1. [Read passwd](poly_passwd.md)
2. [Execve](poly_execve.md)
3. [Flush Iptables](poly_flush.md)
