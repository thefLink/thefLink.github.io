## SLAE64

As a preparation for the OSCE course I decided to take the SecurityTube Linux Assembly64 Expert (SLAE64) class to get a good understanding of assembly and shellcoding in particular.

The course is completly self-paced, meaning that there is no schedule or limited lab time as you might know it from OSCP.
In my opinion the class is extremly helpfull and teaches valuable lessons and tricks to write short and reliable shellcode, thank you for this course. 

In order to obtain a certificate from this course seven assignments of a different level of difficulty must be done and I present my solutions here on this blog.   

The Assignments are:
1. [Authenticated bindshell](AuthBindShell.md)
2. [Authenticated reverse shell](AuthReverseShell.md)
3. [Egghunter](EggHunter.md)
4. [Custom encoder](Encoder.md)
5. [Analyse shellcode](Analyse.md)
6. [Polymorphic shellcode](Polymorphic.md)
7. [Custom encrypter](Encrypter.md)

The complete shellcode can be found on my github account:
